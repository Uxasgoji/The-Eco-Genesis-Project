		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<h3>We at the Eco-Genesis Project are commited to studying the intracacies of ecosystems along with what factors can contribute to their success and failings. We maintain our carefully contructed artificial ecosystems on the Halomura chain of islands (fictional location) in the Pacific Ocean where we allow genetically engineered organisms to co-exist together and determine what factors wether it be from the creatures themselves or external forces can disrupt or aid local environments. Our goal is to gather as much knowledge as possible and use on natural ecosystems to potentially undo much of the damage done to nature.</h3>

		<h2>Ethical Concerns</h2>
		<h3>We understand that you may be concerned ablout the ethics of creating new organisms, maintaining completely artifical ecosystems, and experiementing on them. We at the Eco-Genesis Project attempt to avoid directly mistreating the organisms under our watch and attempt to refrain from using our technology irresponsibly, <strong>click here</strong> to read more about our practices.</h3>
